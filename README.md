# console-either
Either.io for the console

Just play either.io in the console!

It's not the best code, but it'll help if ur a programming who's trying to learn how to interface with websites using python and the requests library.

If you want to you can use this code in your own projects, like if you want to build a either.io bot for a social media platform, or something of the sort.
